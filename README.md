# 🌐 Web Clones Collection

This repository is a collection of front-end clone projects I’m building to strengthen my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Each project lives in its own folder, making it easy to explore and run individually.  
Over time, this will grow into a showcase of different interfaces and layouts I’ve recreated.

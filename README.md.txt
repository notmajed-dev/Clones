# Web Clones Collection

This repository is a collection of front‑end clone projects I’m building to strengthen my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Each project is organized in its own folder, making it easy to explore and run individually. Over time, this will grow into a showcase of different interfaces and layouts I’ve recreated.
